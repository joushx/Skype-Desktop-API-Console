Skype-Desktop-API-Console
=========================

A console application for testing the skype desktop api.

This application was created in minutes for having a console for testing the API without the need of recompiling the code every time.

As an result the code quality is quite low. Even one "goto" command was used. ;)

I'm looking forward to make this better in the future.
